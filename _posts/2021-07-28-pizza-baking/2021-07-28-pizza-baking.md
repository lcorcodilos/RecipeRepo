# Toppings
## Cheese
If you can, get a block of whole milk, low-moisture mozzarella. The pre-shredded stuff has additives to keep the shreds from clumping that hurt the ability for the cheese to be stretchy like you want in a good pizza slice. The skim/2% cheese doesn't have enough fat to keep it from burning in the oven before the crust has cooked.

You can use fresh mozz as another topping but keep in mind that it contributes more moisture (so higher chance of pizza soup) and by itself it can't act as a barrier to keep your sauce from evaporating away in the oven. Again, there's a big battle to keep moisture low but to also not lose too much of it.

# Baking - Home oven (max 550 F)
- For cooking, you want a pre-heated oven as hot as you can get it (usually 500 or 550 F) with your cooking surface pre-heating in it as well.  If you can get your oven to just be on constantly, just do that.For the cooking surface, you want something with high heat capacity like cast iron, a thick baking steal, or a pizza stone (though some pizza stones don't like the super high temps so you may risk cracking it). Once heated, I'd recommend taking the cooking surface out of the oven, resting it on the stove, putting the rolled out dough (with no toppings) onto it, and then topping. This gives the bottom crust a chance to form while you avoid having to move a fully topped, uncooked pizza.
- My only warning is for real broilers. Some ovens say "Broil" and it just means "oven always on" while others have an actual heating element on the top of the oven. If your oven has the top heating element, it might seem like using it is a good idea to cook toppings. Maybe to finish the cooking that would be fine but don't pre-heat your oven with it. The oven itself won't get to a high enough temp, you could damage your cooking surface with the close heat, etc. Just treat the high cooking surface temperature as the priority and you'll be fine.
- Top the pizza with sauce, then delicate herbs (basil, etc that could burn), then cheese, then anything that could benefit from direct high heat (pepperoni, mushrooms, peppers, etc). 
- Put it all in the oven and cook until the crust is well browned or the cheese/toppings have cooked - hopefully this happens at the same time. It's usually 10-15 minutes.
